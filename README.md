__[IN PROGRESS]__ API wrapper for stockfighter.io written in Go

Currently only based on their  documentation @ https://starfighter.readme.io/ and not tested beyond what's in [example.go](./example.go) as stockfigher itself isn't live yet.

### Usage
You can use the api wrapper in your own go packages:

	import "github.com/ianberinger/stockfighter/api"

Documentation via [godoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/ianberinger/stockfighter/api) & usage example in [example.go](./example.go)
